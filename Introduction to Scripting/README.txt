- I have finished the two parts of the tutorial, solving some error that I found.

- I have changed some game settings (machine speed, sheep speed, etc ...).

- I have added more spawn points, which are added throughout the game, starting with 2 and increasing to 5 (Every 10 sheep saved is added one).

- Also modify the speed of the sheep, which increases throughout the game (Every 5 sheep saved the speed increases).

- Finally add a "Best Score" on the home screen, to know your best score.
